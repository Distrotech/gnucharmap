This is the README for gucharmap.

gucharmap is a featureful unicode character map. You can get the
latest version from http://gucharmap.sourceforge.net/


COMPILING

gucharmap uses GTK+ 2.2 or later, which you can get from
http://gtk.org/. 

If GNOME is available, gucharmap uses it, but only to make the Help
menu.

To compile and install, do the usual

   ./configure
   make
   make install

There are two extra ./configure options:

  --disable-gnome disables GNOME-only functionality, even if the GNOME
    libraries are found. 

  --disable-unihan disables CJK ideograph information. The ideograph
    information includes definition and pronunciations in several
    languages, and is extracted from [3]. Omitting the ideograph
    information will reduce gucharmap's size by roughly 2 megabytes.


GUCHARMAP INPUT METHOD

What is this thing? Open up, for example, gedit. Right-click in the
editable area. Hover over "Input Methods". The list of input methods
you currently have available will pop up. If you try a couple, you'll
see what they do.

Most of these affect what happens when you type in the window. The
gucharmap input method is a little different. It opens up a gucharmap
window. When you double-click on a character, it goes directly into
your document.

Getting the gucharmap input method to show up in the list requires
a little extra work on your part. The list comes from a file, called
gtk.immodules. On my system, it is installed in 
/etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules
It would be rude of gucharmap to write over that file, so it installs
its version of gtk.immodules in a different place: 
${prefix}/etc/gucharmap/gtk.immodules.
where ${prefix} is the prefix where gucharmap is installed (/usr/local
by default). gucharmap's version of gtk.immodules includes all the the
input modules in GTK+'s version, plus gucharmap.

You have to tell GTK+ to use gucharmap's version of gtk.immodules if
you want to use the gucharmap input module (which you do!). To do
this, set the environment variable GTK_IM_MODULE_FILE to
${prefix}/etc/gucharmap/gtk.immodules. For example, you can put these
lines in your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile or /etc/profile or
somewhere:

GTK_IM_MODULE_FILE=${prefix}/etc/gucharmap/gtk.immodules
export GTK_IM_MODULE_FILE

Replace ${prefix} with the prefix where gucharmap is installed.

Alternatively, you can simply write over GTK+'s gtk.immodules with
gucharmap's version. For example:

# mv /etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules /etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules.bak
# cp ${prefix}/etc/gucharmap/gtk.immodules /etc/gtk-2.0/.
