This is the README for gucharmap.

gucharmap is a unicode character map and font viewer.

gucharmap depends on GTK+ 2.0 (or later, hopefully), which you can get
from http://gtk.org/.

To compile and install, do the usual

   ./configure
   make
   make install

There are no extra configure options (yet).

You can get the latest version of gucharmap at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gucharmap

gucharmap was influenced by Juliusz Chroboczek's ucm

the windows character map, and GNOME's gcharmap.
