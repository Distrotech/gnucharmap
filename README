This is the README for gucharmap.

gucharmap is a featureful unicode character map. You can get the
latest version from http://gucharmap.sourceforge.net/


COMPILING

gucharmap uses GTK+ 2.2 or later, which you can get from
http://gtk.org/. 

If GNOME is available, gucharmap uses it, but only to make the Help
menu.

To compile and install, do the usual

   ./configure
   make
   make install

There are two extra ./configure options:

  --disable-gnome disables GNOME-only functionality, even if the GNOME
    libraries are found. 

  --disable-unihan disables CJK ideograph information. The ideograph
    information includes definition and pronunciations in several
    languages, and is extracted from [3]. Omitting the ideograph
    information will reduce gucharmap's size by roughly 2 megabytes.


GUCHARMAP INPUT METHOD

What is this thing? Open up, for example, gedit. Right-click in the
editable area. Hover over "Input Methods". The list of input methods
you currently have available will pop up. If you try a couple, you'll
see what they do.

Most of these affect what happens when you type in the window. The
gucharmap input method is a little different. It opens up a gucharmap
window. When you double-click on a character, it goes directly into
your document.

Installation overwrites the system-wide input module cache file,
normally /etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules. (This is the right thing to do,
see http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112099.)

You will want to add ${prefix}/lib/gtk-2.0/$(GTK_BINARY_VERSION)/immodules,
the directory where the input modules are installed, to your
system-wide GTK_PATH.
