This is the README for gucharmap.

gucharmap is a unicode character map and font viewer.
You can get the latest version of from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gucharmap

gucharmap uses GTK+ 2.0 (or later, hopefully), which you can get from
http://gtk.org/.

To compile and install, do the usual

   ./configure
   make
   make install

There is one extra ./configure option, --disable-unihan, which you
should use if you don't want CJK ideograph information. The ideograph
information includes definition and pronunciations in several
languages, and is extracted from [3]. Omitting the ideograph
information will reduce gucharmap's size by roughly 2 megabytes.

gucharmap was influenced by Juliusz Chroboczek's ucm

Windows charmap, and GNOME's gcharmap.
