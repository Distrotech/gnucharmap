 - Get all the information in the caption. [DONE]

 - Navigate by unicode block and codepoint (GtkTreeView on the right?) [DONE]

 - Scrollbar on the tabulus [DONE]

 - Move up and down one row at a time in the tabulus [DONE]

 - Figure out something good for resizing and stuff [DONE]

 - Maybe change the keyboard and mouse navigation to do prelight stuff;
   only blue when you click or press enter or whatever?

 - Text to copy: can do this like gnome-character-map [DONE]

 - Paste to jump to a character [DONE]

 - Accessibility stuff, see 
   http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gap/guide/gad/index.html

 - Magnify active character, as in windows charmap? [DONE]

 - Pull the search and text-to-copy out of the charmap widget. [DONE]

 - Do all the text direction stuff, including connecting to that
   direction-changed signal. In a RTL locale, U+0000 should be in the
   upper right. [DONE??]

 - Replace bootstrap with autogen.sh. [DONE]

 - Write the shell script that automates generation of the source
   files that are based on uincode.org information. Make it part of
   the build process?? Maybe the autogen process...

 - Do something about accessibility. This might mean having the
   charmap implement AtkTable as suggested by hp.

 - Handle --version, --help, etc., even when built without gnome.

 - Add a --disable-gnome option to the configury. [DONE]

 - Accels for some of the menu items.

 - Use keynav from theme with GtkBindingSet.

 - Think about sending signals and messages instead of exporting the
   statusbar widget. [DONE]

 - Fix the mini_fontsel quirks and bugs.

 - Write gtk docs for the charmap and mini_fontsel widgets.

 - Find out about strangenesses (like the list of DnD targets) and fix
   them if appropriate.

 - Think about the search; should it find computed hangul syllables,
   etc?

 - Write or solicit some help. The F1 kind.
 
 - Unicode annotations and cross references (suggested by Markus Kuhn).

 - MiniFontSelection needs some accessibility.
 
 - Position the zoom window better; I have a plan, it's simple, but
   not worth writing down.

 - Edit menu.

 - Font selection should be tabbable-to.

 - Menu item(s) to enter and exit zoom mode.

 - Get rid of the triangle in the character details; instead, put
   items in the view menu, e.g. Extra Unicode Info, CJK Info, (Notes,
   See Also, ... NamesList.txt stuff)

 - Maybe make Find a dialog box?? Seems like a fine way to do it, but
   there's nothing really wrong that I can think of with the current
   way.

 - Maybe make the size of the zoom font configurable?

 - Tooltips on the scrollbar.

 - Daniel doesn't like the case (upper) of the character names.

 - Allow people to type code points in the search box?

 - Split Expand/Collapse All into two menu items?

 - Save state???

 - Make all references to characters links-- click to jump to the
   character.

 - Web browser-like forward/back for characters visited? Need to be
   smart about what to count as "visited".

 - gunihan, another program in the gucharmap package, with the same
   functionality as http://www.unicode.org/charts/unihansearch.html
   (suggested by Sebastien).

 - A gtk+ input module that uses the charmap.

 - Separate the public and private parts of teh charmap struct(s) and
   stuff.
